Receptsamling
Created by: Fredrik Andreasson
--------------------

v0.4
--------------------
Reading AND writing to the database-file is working correctly.
Recipes are seperated by newlines and each piece of a recipe is separated by commas.
--------------------

v0.3.1
--------------------
The application will now read the file "receptlista" (from one directory above) upon start.
If the file doesn't exist, it will be created in a new directory "Receptsamling" one step above it.
This function currently serves no purpose, as the program currently doesn't handle the data in any way.
--------------------

v0.3
--------------------
Changing already existing recipes now working!

Moved piece of code to more relevant areas. Program unaffected.
--------------------

v0.2.4
--------------------
Added a missing bit of code that caused the program to crash if you pressed "Ta Bort" with no items in the list.

Base code added for changing an already existing recipe. Button disabled as it currently doesn't work.

Changed a lot of code to be more logical. Program itself is unaffected.
--------------------

v0.2.3
--------------------
Fixed so that the list of ingredients and the "How To" box doesn't stack different data after each other
when switching between recipes.
--------------------

v0.2.2
--------------------
Clicking on the contents of a cell now properly shows all related data in the view to the right.
--------------------

v0.2.1
--------------------
Changed the singleline textbox for ingredients to a multiline textbox instead.
Ingredients are now separated by 'Enter' rather than commas.

Fixed the Grid so that the cells are always at their max width and can't be resized.
You can, however, change how much of each cell you want to see.

Disabled cell editing through clicking or hitting F2.
Editing individual recipes can only be done through the "Ändra" button (NYI).
--------------------

v0.2
--------------------
Remove recipe button now working.
Select the recipe you want to remove from the view and click the "Ta Bort" button.
--------------------

v0.1.1
--------------------
Adding recipes and making them appear in the DataGrid now works, but they don't save.
--------------------

v0.1
--------------------
The main form was created. No coding attached yet.
--------------------

v0.0.1
--------------------
Project Started
